# Harvard's Art Collection

This is my final project of Module 4 at the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io/). The goal of the project was to mimic a take home project where you are required to learn a new piece of technology over a few days. The new tech was [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and using the [Harvard Art Museum API](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs), I was instructed to build an art gallery.
