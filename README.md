# Harvard's Art Collection

This is my final project of Module 4 at the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io/). The goal of the project was to mimic a take home project where you are required to learn a new piece of technology over a few days. The new tech was [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and using the [Harvard Art Museum API](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs), I was instructed to build an art gallery. 

## Installation and Setup Instructions

* `git clone https://github.com/saadricklamar/harvard-art.git`
* `cd cycle-city`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Then, go to `http://localhost:8080/` to see the code running in the browser

## Tech Stack

Vue.js, Vue Router, Vue Test Utils, Jest, Javascript.
